# Cardputer Games Collection

Welcome to the Cardputer Games Collection! This repository is a showcase of classic games adapted for the Cardputer, a versatile development platform based on the ESP32. From the inception of the idea to the final execution, this project has been a journey of exploration, learning, and collaboration with AI technology. Dive into the world of game development on the Cardputer and see what's possible with a bit of creativity and guidance from AI.

## About the Project

This project began as an exploration of the Cardputer's capabilities, aiming to create engaging, classic games that run smoothly on this compact yet powerful device. With the assistance of OpenAI's GPT, we've successfully developed versions of "Pong" and "Breakout" that not only entertain but also demonstrate the Cardputer's potential for game development and more.

### Games Included

- **Pong**: The timeless arcade classic, reimagined for the Cardputer. Challenge yourself against the computer in a game of skill, reflexes, and persistence.
- **Breakout**: Break bricks and score high in this addictive arcade game. Each level cleared is a step further in mastering the Cardputer.

## Features

- Detailed instructions for setting up the Cardputer for game development.
- Optimized game code for smooth performance and minimal flicker.
- Creative use of the Cardputer's display and input capabilities.
- Sound effects to enhance gameplay experience (with the option to mute).
- Learning resources and insights gained from developing with AI assistance.
